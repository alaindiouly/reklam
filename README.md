reklam is email automation service for entrepreneurs

imagine being an entrepreneur and looking for feedback for your mvp, or a new feature in your legacy product. apart from your mum, you'd like a selection of early adopters and/or power users to provide you with their first impressions on what you've been developing.
let's assume a response rate for online surveys in the 10-15%, usually sent to users' personal or professional email address. there may be several reasons for a lower rate, from which I see the following:

- clicking on a survey answers make you navigate away from your email client
- recipients cannot see right away, within th body of the email, how many questions they'll need to answer (this is the reason you'll see catchphrase like "please" or "it will only take five minutes" etc.). even though your recipients may be heavy users of your products, high chances are they will instinctively delete your survey email
- entrepreneurs with non-tech background or low technical proficiency may be scared away from the intricacies of fully-fledged solutions like mailchimp. think about brick-and-mortars shops, craftmen, service professionals: they wouldn't mind getting to know what their clients think about their services and products, they lack the patience and the knowledge, even for mainstream emailing solutions

less is more. the app is a pared-down solution which allows business owners to generate and send out surveys in a matter of minutes. clients on the receiving side, as they open the email, know how many questions to answer. on and all there's a fair chance of higher response rate
